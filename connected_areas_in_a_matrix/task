Connected Areas in a Matrix

Letâ€™s define a connected area in a matrix as an area
of cells in which there is a path between every two cells.

Write a program to find all connected areas in a matrix.

Input

On the first line, you will get the number of rows.
On the second line, you will get the number of columns.
The rest of the input will be the actual matrix.

Output

Print on the console the total number of areas found.
On a separate line for each area print its starting coordinates and size.
Order the areas by size (in descending order) so that the largest area is printed first.
If several areas have the same size, order them by their position,
first by the row, then by the column of the top-left corner.
If there are two connected areas of the same size, the one which is
above and/or to the left of the other will be printed first.
