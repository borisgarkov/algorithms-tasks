Move Down / Right

Marinette has the ability to transform into Ladybug.
She is stuck on a grid. Her initial location is at the
top-left corner and tries to move to the bottom-right corner.
However, she can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Write a program that prints the number of all possible unique
paths that Marinette can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

Input

On the first line you will receive an integer – m – number of rows.
On the second line you will receive an integer – n – number of cols.

Output

Print the number of all possible unique paths to the bottom-right corner.

Constraints

m and n will always be in the range [0… 1000].
